				<h2>About</h2>

				<div>

					I am from Hyderabad, India. I graduated from Osmania University with my Bachelor’s in Computer Science in 2017. I was working as a Software Developer in Defense Research and Development Organization for almost 2 years. At DRDO, I was a part of the Predictive Analysis Engine. I’m happy to apply the experience and skills I’ve obtained in my career in order to manage projects through creative problem solving and innovative thinking. I possess a strong eye for detail and can thrive independently as well as in a team environment.

Whether you need someone for a short-term project, or a long-term collaboration, I’d love to hear from you. You’re invited to explore my work and contact me so we can discuss how we can do some great work together.
